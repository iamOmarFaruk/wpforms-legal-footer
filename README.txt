Add professional "Terms and Conditions" and "Privacy Policy" links under your WPForms submit buttons with smart auto-detection.

== Description ==

**WPForms Legal Footer** is the easiest way to add legal compliance links to your forms. It integrates directly into the WPForms builder, giving you a native, "official" experience.

**Why use this plugin?**
Adding legal text under a submit button usually requires custom HTML or CSS. This plugin adds a dedicated **"Legal Footer"** tab to your Form Settings, allowing you to configure everything visually.

**Key Features:**

*   **Smart Auto-Detection (New v1.2)**: Automatically scans your site for "Privacy Policy" and "Terms" pages and pre-selects them for you.
*   **Dual Link Support**: Easily add both a Primary Link (e.g., Privacy Policy) and a Secondary Link (e.g., Terms & Conditions).
*   **Native Integration**: Works inside the WPForms Builder > Settings tab. No extra menus to find.
*   **Visual Customization**:
    *   **Bold Text**: Toggle for better visibility.
    *   **Typography**: Set font size and color to match your brand.
    *   **Alignment**: Left, Center, or Right align your footer.
*   **Conditional Logic**: Settings remain clean and hidden until enabled.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  **Open any Form**: Go to **WPForms > Edit Form**.
4.  **Configure**: Navigate to **Settings > Legal Footer**.
5.  **Enable**: Toggle "Enable Legal Footer". The plugin will try to auto-fill your pages!
